I am a particle physicist by training, with a PhD from the University of Washington on searching for neutrinoless double-beta decay with crystal germanium detectors. Since then, I've been working at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, CA on the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment, searching for WIMP dark matter.

I'm currently looking to transition into the climate tech sector. I have extensive experience in high-level big-data analysis gained over the 8 years I've been doing physics research, which will be highly transferrable to any data science role. In the last severeal years I have also begun incorporating machine learning into my research.

Thanks for reading my website!
